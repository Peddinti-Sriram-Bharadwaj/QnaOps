üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture
This project implements a classic microservices pattern orchestrated by Kubernetes. User traffic is routed through an Nginx reverse proxy to a scalable FastAPI backend, which leverages PostgreSQL for persistent storage and Redis for high-speed caching. The entire lifecycle is automated via a Jenkins pipeline, with Ansible handling complex configurations and the EFK stack providing deep observability.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Deep Dive
fastapi_app/: Contains the core business logic. It's a Python application built with the FastAPI framework, chosen for its high performance and automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. The Dockerfile packages it into a lightweight, portable container.
k8s/: This is the heart of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation.
fastapi-deployment.yaml: Defines a Deployment resource to manage stateless FastAPI pods.
fastapi-hpa.yaml: A HorizontalPodAutoscaler that automatically scales the FastAPI deployment based on CPU utilization metrics.
postgres.yaml & redis.yaml: Likely define StatefulSet resources for the database and cache, ensuring stable network identifiers and persistent storage.
nginx-deployment.yaml: Deploys Nginx as a reverse proxy, managed by a Deployment. The nginx-configmap.yaml injects routing rules to direct traffic to the FastAPI service.
ansible/: Implements Configuration as Code (CaC).
The playbooks automate tasks beyond simple resource creation, such as database schema initialization, application configuration, and setting up the complex EFK (Elasticsearch, Filebeat, Kibana) stack.
secrets.yaml and vault_pass.txt indicate the use of Ansible Vault for securely managing sensitive data like passwords and API tokens.
Jenkinsfile: A declarative pipeline script that defines the entire CI/CD process, ensuring a repeatable and reliable path from code to production.
üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Ensure your environment is equipped with the following tools:

Minikube: For local Kubernetes cluster creation.
kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool.
Docker: The container runtime.
Ansible: For automation and configuration management.
Jenkins: To run the CI/CD pipeline.
üöÄ Getting Started
Clone the Repository

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Peddinti-Sriram-Bharadwaj/QnaOps.git
cd QnaOps
 Initialize the Environment
Execute the master script to bring up the Minikube cluster and prepare the environment.

Bash
./minikube-start.sh
 Deploy Kubernetes Resources
Apply the Kubernetes manifests to declaratively create the entire application stack.

Bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
 Run Ansible Playbooks
Execute the main Ansible playbook to configure the deployed services. Ensure vault_pass.txt is populated.

Bash
# Example command
ansible-playbook ansible/deploy-app.yaml --vault-password-file ansible/vault_pass.txt
üî¨ Usage & Automation Scripts
A collection of utility scripts are provided in the root directory to streamline development and operational tasks.

| Script                  | Icon | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------- | :--: | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| get-url.sh            |  üîó  | Fetches the Minikube service URL to access the application.     |
| get_pods.sh           |  üì¶  | Lists all running pods in the current Kubernetes namespace.    |
| rollout_app.sh        |  üîÑ  | Triggers a rolling restart of the main application deployment. |
| load-test.sh          |  ‚ö°  | Executes a basic load test against the FastAPI endpoint.       |
| hpa-usage.sh          |  üìä  | Checks the current status and metrics of the HPA.              |
| forward-*.sh          |  üîå  | Forwards ports for postgres and redis to localhost.      |
| get-*-pass.sh         |  üîë  | Retrieves secrets (e.g., database passwords) from Kubernetes.  |

üîÑ CI/CD & DevOps Workflow
The Jenkinsfile orchestrates the following automated pipeline:

Trigger: The pipeline is automatically triggered by a commit to the main branch.
Lint & Test: (Implied) Static code analysis and unit tests are run to ensure code quality.
Build: The build_and_push.sh script is executed. It builds a new Docker image for the fastapi_app and tags it with the build number or commit hash.
Push: The newly tagged image is pushed to a configured container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GCR, ECR).
Deploy: Jenkins authenticates with the Kubernetes cluster and updates the fastapi-deployment.yaml to use the new image tag, triggering a zero-downtime rolling update.
üìä Observability Stack
The project includes a robust observability solution using the EFK stack, deployed and configured via Ansible.

Filebeat: Deployed as a DaemonSet on each Kubernetes node to collect logs from all application pods.
Elasticsearch: A powerful search and analytics engine that stores and indexes the log data received from Filebeat.
Kibana: A web interface for querying, visualizing, and creating dashboards from the data in Elasticsearch.
Metricbeat: The metricbeat-values.yaml suggests Metricbeat is used to collect system and service metrics from the cluster.
Use the kibana-forward.sh and elastic-forward.sh scripts to access the services locally.
